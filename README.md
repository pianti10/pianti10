<h4 align="left">Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm NicolÃ¡s Piantini, I'm 28 years old and I live in the province of Mendoza, Argentina. Throughout these years, I went through different university careers related to Engineering and Accounting, looking for what identifies me as a professional. Later on, I enrolled as an Insurance Consultant Producer, a job I currently perform in a customer service office. Recently I graduated from the Bootcamp "Soy Henry" as a Full Stack Developer, where I developed an individual application applying the following technologies: Front End - JavaScript - React - Redux - HTML - CSS Back End - Node.js - Express - PostgreSQL I also learned to work in a team, using Git, Jira and Trello, managing to develop another web application of greater complexity. I consider myself a responsible person, involved in his work, with a lot of dedication and enthusiasm for learning new things. My goal is to insert myself in the IT world to continue growing and developing as a professional, constantly training and learning new technologies.</h4>
